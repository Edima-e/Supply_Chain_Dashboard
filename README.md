# 📦 Supply Chain Dashboard

## 📌 Overview

This project is an **Excel-based Supply Chain Dashboard** designed to **optimize order fulfillment** and **reduce delivery backlogs**. It leverages historical delivery data to identify bottlenecks, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel** – For data analysis and dashboard creation
* **Pivot Tables & Charts** – To summarize and visualize KPIs
* **Conditional Formatting** – To highlight critical metrics
* **Data Cleaning & Transformation** – For accurate reporting

## ✅ Key Features

* Tracks **on-time delivery performance** and highlights delays
* Identifies **bottlenecks by zone, vehicle type, and driver performance**
* Analyzes **delay patterns by route and time of day**
* Compares **allocation rules (Standard / Custom / Expedited)** for efficiency
* Provides **interactive filters** for dynamic analysis (Region, Date, Driver, etc.)

## 📈 Key Metrics Snapshot *(Example placeholders – replace with actual values)*

* **Average Delivery Lead Time:** 151.77 minutes
* **Total Backlog Orders:** 767
* **Top Performing City:** City D (Average delay 14.09 minute)
* **City with Most Delays:** City E (Average delay 15.29 minutes)

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Backlogs occur primarily in **South Zone** and during **peak hours**
* **Expedited allocation rule** significantly reduces delays compared to Standard
* Delivery performance improves when lead time and vehicle type are optimized
* Certain routes show **higher delay frequency**, suggesting route re-planning
